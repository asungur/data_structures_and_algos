# âž—Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to popular algorithms and data structures.

My plan is to implement each solution in **Go** and **Ruby.** However, some problems might only have one implementation.

Some problems include variations. These are kept in the same folder.

## Algorithms

[Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)
Basically, a set of rules to solve a given problem. Commonly, they work hand in hand with data structures.


## Data Structures

[Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)
Depending on the actual problem, using different data structures bring efficiency (speed/memory) to our solution. Understanding their trade-offs and where to use them is as important as understanding how they work.
